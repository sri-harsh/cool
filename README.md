Sentiment analysis of people using Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Machine Learning(ML)

Stress in students is a worrying factor and many times it leads to depression/hypertension, where in a few cases, the person may take drastic steps. Majority of the people use smartphones and are very active on social media. The tool we are working on is used to understand the psychological and emotional state of the people(/students) by analysing their social media behaviour.

The tool works on integration with any of the social media platforms. The tool performs NLP, ML techniques and analyses the data retrieved from the posts shared by the users that the person who integrated the tool with is connected to. We perform image analysis to extract text and for direct text posts we analyse them using sentiment dictionaries like vader. If the results seem to be a bit of suspicion that the person who shared it is suffering from depression the tool generates a relevant optimistic quotes and display it to the user, if in case the level or degree of depression seems to be very severe then the personâ€™s closest connections are informed.
